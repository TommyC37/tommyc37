### About me

- âš¡ Fun fact: I got my start in sales/marketing. Looking to bring that customer-focused, user experience-driven mindset to the dev world!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a shopping list generator for health-minded cooks looking to explore new recipes. Enter your dietary restrictions/calorie limit, choose your recipes for the week, and voila! You've got your self a shopping list.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript via Launch School. I already know enough Javascript, Node.JS, Express, etc. to build websites, but Launch School is a chance to go deeper and really become an expert in Javascript.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d love to collab with anyone who has a design or visual arts background. With your design expertise and my experience in sales/marketing, we could make a killer web dev agency!
